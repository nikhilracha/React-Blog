        "description": " Airbnb  will also reportedly delay hiring undergraduate students until next year. TechCrunch has since heard from an incoming intern that he was notified yesterday and that he’s now scrambling to find a new internship. 'I’m devastated about the decision, both because I turned down many competitive offers in favor of Airbnb and because they made the decision so late that it will be incredibly difficult to find new opportunities in such a short time frame,' Ray Iyer, a computer science major at Stanford, told TechCrunch . :I’m relying on social media resources like LinkedIn to directly source opportunities, and this has led to some promising leads. Nonetheless, with the state of the virus and the fact that most internships will have to be remote, very few companies are hiring right now. I am graduating next year, and this summer was an opportunity to get my foot in the door and alleviate the stress of full-time recruiting in these uncertain times. I’m definitely going to put in my best effort to find a suitable replacement opportunity.",
